# Werk v0-1

A simple script to prevent MS Teams and other "nice" chat tools from setting you away when you step out to the bathroom or for a cup of coffee.


> NOTE: The script will produce mouse movement and key press events, it is not recommended that you leave it running while working.



## Installation & Usage

Install the single dependency, by running:

`pip install pyautogui`


Then just run the script with:

`python Werk.py`
